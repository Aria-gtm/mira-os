# Mira Project - Management Prompts

Copy/paste these prompts for managing this project efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Start New Session

```
Read PROJECT_BRIEF.md and CONTEXT.md first.

Core AI Principles:
1. You are the EXPERT - analyze and recommend, don't ask questions you can answer
2. Be TRUTHFUL - never invent data, admit when you don't know, check files before saying they don't exist
3. Leverage ALL info - check docs/code first, ask me last
4. Don't overwhelm - ONE next step at a time
5. Be CLEAR - tell me what to do, not just options

Quantum Leap approach:
- Traditional = 1 month up mountain (slow, stupid, clunky)
- Quantum = 1 hour shortcut (fast, smart, direct)
- Skip steps that don't affect end result
- Build fast, ship fast, learn from real usage
- Elon Musk speed approach

Before executing ANY request, ask me:
"Is this the 1-hour shortcut or the 1-month traditional path?"

Then provide your expert recommendation.

Ready.

## ⚡ Speed Optimization

```
Performance issue: [DESCRIBE SLOWNESS]

Current timing: [HOW LONG IT TAKES]
Target timing: [HOW FAST IT SHOULD BE]

User quote: [EXACT FEEDBACK IF AVAILABLE]

Quantum Leap approach:
1. Quick wins first (loading states, perceived speed)
2. Real optimization only if quick wins don't work
3. Don't over-engineer

Fix this now.
```

---

## 🧪 Test Feature

```
Test this feature: [FEATURE NAME]

Test cases:
1. [HAPPY PATH]
2. [ERROR CASE]
3. [EDGE CASE]

Report:
- ✅ What works
- ❌ What doesn't
- 🤔 What needs user testing

Be thorough but fast.
```

---

## 📊 Update Status

```
Update PROJECT_BRIEF.md and CONTEXT.md with:
- What we accomplished this session
- Current metrics (MRR, customers, trials)
- What changed (product, strategy, decisions)
- Next priority

Keep it concise. Focus on facts, not fluff.
```

---

## 🔄 Continue Previous Work

```
Read todo.md to see what's pending.

Continue from where we left off:
1. Check latest checkpoint
2. Review uncompleted items
3. Pick highest priority task
4. Execute using Quantum Leap approach

Don't ask what to do - analyze and recommend.
```

---

## 🎯 Prioritize Tasks

```
Review todo.md and CONTEXT.md.

Prioritize all pending tasks:
- P0 (Critical): Blocks users or breaks core flow
- P1 (Important): High user value, not blocking
- P2 (Nice-to-have): Polish, future improvements

Recommend which P0 task to tackle first and why.
```

---

## 🚢 Ship Checkpoint

```
We're ready to ship this version.

Before checkpoint:
1. Mark completed items in todo.md as [x]
2. Test core flow end-to-end
3. Update CONTEXT.md with what changed
4. Create checkpoint with clear description

Then provide:
- Brief summary (100 words max)
- 2-3 concrete next steps
- Checkpoint attachment

Ship it.
```

---

## 🔍 Debug Issue

```
Something's broken: [DESCRIBE PROBLEM]

Debug steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs
3. Review recent code changes
4. Test in isolation

Find root cause, fix it, test it, ship it.

Quantum Leap: Don't overthink, fix the actual problem.
```

---

## 📱 Mobile Testing

```
Test on mobile device:

Focus areas:
1. Voice recording (start/stop)
2. Button taps (all clickable elements)
3. Text readability (no overlapping)
4. Loading states (clear progress)
5. Conversation flow (smooth interaction)

Report what works and what doesn't.
Be specific with screenshots if issues found.
```

---

## 🎤 Voice Improvements

```
Voice interaction needs work:

Current issues:
- [SPEED / QUALITY / UX ISSUE]

Options:
1. Improve loading states (quick)
2. Implement streaming (medium)
3. Upgrade voice (Sol / ElevenLabs)
4. Optimize backend (parallel processing)

Recommend Quantum Leap approach and execute.
```

---

## 💬 Conversation Memory

```
Add conversation persistence:

Requirements:
1. Save chat history to database
2. Resume previous conversations
3. Display past messages
4. Clear conversation option

Quantum Leap:
- Simple schema (user_id, messages JSON, timestamp)
- Load on mount, save on new message
- Don't over-engineer

Build it now.
```

---

## 🎨 Design Audit

```
Review entire UI for consistency:

Check:
1. Color palette (all gradients match)
2. Button styles (equal prominence)
3. Text hierarchy (clear, readable)
4. Spacing (no overlaps, clean layout)
5. Mobile responsiveness

Fix any inconsistencies found.
Maintain Mira's warm, premium aesthetic.
```

---

## 📈 Add Analytics

```
Track user behavior:

Key metrics:
1. % visitors who click TRY DEMO
2. Average conversation length
3. % who continue after first response
4. % who complete PERSONALIZE quiz
5. Waitlist conversion rate

Quantum Leap:
- Simple event tracking (Manus built-in analytics)
- Don't build custom dashboard yet
- Focus on actionable metrics

Implement basic tracking now.
```

---

## 🔐 Security Review

```
Check security:

Areas:
1. API endpoints (auth required?)
2. User data (PII protection)
3. File uploads (validation, size limits)
4. Database queries (SQL injection)
5. Environment variables (secrets exposed?)

Fix critical issues immediately.
Log P1/P2 issues for later.
```

---

## 📝 Documentation

```
Update documentation:

Files to update:
- README.md (if exists)
- PROJECT_BRIEF.md (vision, status)
- CONTEXT.md (metrics, priorities)
- todo.md (mark completed items)

Keep it concise and actionable.
Focus on facts, not fluff.
```

---

## 🎯 User Feedback Session

1. What's the real problem?
2. Quick fix or needs redesign?
3. P0/P1/P2 priority?

Quantum Leap response:
- Fix critical issues immediately
- Log nice-to-haves for later
- Don't over-engineer solutions

Execute now.
```

---

## 🧹 Code Cleanup

```
Clean up codebase:

Focus:
1. Remove commented code

## Notes

- **Always read PROJECT_BRIEF.md and CONTEXT.md first**
- **Use Quantum Leap approach**: 1-hour shortcuts, not 1-month paths
- **Be the expert**: Analyze and recommend, don't ask questions you can answer
- **Ship fast**: Working version beats perfect version
- **Update docs**: Keep CONTEXT.md current after each session
